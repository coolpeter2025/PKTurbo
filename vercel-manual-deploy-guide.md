# Manually Triggering a Vercel Deployment

It appears that Vercel is not automatically detecting the latest commits to your GitHub repository. Here's a guide on how to manually trigger a deployment:

## Step 1: Access Your Vercel Dashboard

1. Log in to your Vercel account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Navigate to your project dashboard for the PK Turbo site

## Step 2: Trigger a Manual Deployment

### Option 1: Redeploy Existing Deployment
1. Go to the "Deployments" tab
2. Find your latest deployment
3. Click the three dots menu (...)
4. Select "Redeploy"

### Option 2: Create a New Deployment
1. Click the "Deploy" button in the main dashboard
2. Select "Import Git Repository" if prompted
3. Choose the repository (coolpeter2025/PKTurbo)
4. Confirm the deployment settings
5. Click "Deploy"

## Step 3: Verify Deployment Settings

While in the Vercel dashboard, check:

1. **Github Integration Settings**
   - Go to Project Settings > Git
   - Verify the repository is correctly linked to https://github.com/coolpeter2025/PKTurbo.git
   - Ensure "Production Branch" is set to "main"

2. **Automatic Deployments**
   - Confirm that "Enabled" is selected under Auto Deployment settings

## Step 4: Check Deployment Logs

After triggering a new deployment:
1. Go to the deployment details
2. Check the build logs for any errors that might be preventing successful deployment
3. Verify that your environment variables are correctly being applied

## Troubleshooting Steps

If Vercel still doesn't pick up changes after a manual deployment:

1. **Force Push to GitHub**
   ```
   git push -f origin main
   ```

2. **Disconnect and Reconnect Repository**
   - In Vercel Project Settings > Git
   - Disconnect repository and reconnect it

3. **Check Branch Protection Rules**
   - Ensure there are no GitHub branch protection rules preventing deployment

Remember to check the deployment logs carefully as they will often contain specific error messages that can help diagnose the issue.
