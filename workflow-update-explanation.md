# Supabase Keep-Alive Workflow Update

## Issue Fixed

I've resolved the GitHub Actions workflow error you were experiencing:

```
Error: Missing download info for jps27cse/supabase-keep-alive@main
```

## What Happened

The original workflow was attempting to use a third-party GitHub Action (`jps27cse/supabase-keep-alive@main`) that either:
1. No longer exists
2. Has been made private
3. Was never published

## Solution Implemented

I've updated the primary workflow file (`.github/workflows/supabase-keep-alive.yml`) to use our custom implementation instead of relying on the third-party action. This solution:

1. Uses standard GitHub Actions
2. Sets up Node.js environment
3. Installs the Supabase JS client
4. Runs a direct script to query your database

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No External Dependencies**: The workflow now uses only official GitHub-provided actions
2. **Improved Reliability**: No risk of the third-party action being removed or changed
3. **Better Control**: Full visibility and control over exactly what the script does
4. **Same Functionality**: Still performs the same keep-alive function as originally intended

## Next Steps

Push these changes to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/supabase-keep-alive.yml
git commit -m "Fix: Replace missing third-party action with direct implementation"
git push
```

Then add the Supabase secrets to your GitHub repository as previously instructed and manually trigger the workflow to test it.

The workflow will continue to run automatically at 9:00 AM UTC daily to keep your Supabase project active.
