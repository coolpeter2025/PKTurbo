# MCP Server Status

This document summarizes the current status of the MCP servers after running the fix scripts.

## Weather Server

- ✅ Server is running
- ✅ Server responds to basic requests (info, list tools, list resources)
- ❌ API key needs to be replaced with a real OpenWeather API key
  - The current API key is a placeholder (`YOUR_REAL_API_KEY_HERE`)
  - To fix this, update the `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` in the MCP settings file with a valid API key

## Supabase MCP Server

- ❌ Server has validation errors
- ❌ Configuration needs further fixes
  - The server is encountering validation errors with the configuration
  - The error suggests that there are extra inputs that are not permitted in the configuration
  - Further investigation is needed to determine the correct configuration format

## Git MCP Server

- ❌ Server has validation errors
- ❌ Configuration needs further fixes
  - The server is expecting a different request format than what our check-mcp-status.js script is sending
  - The error suggests that the server is using a newer MCP protocol version
  - Further investigation is needed to determine the correct request format

## Next Steps

1. **Weather Server**:
   - Obtain a valid OpenWeather API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
   - Update the `fix-weather-server.js` script with the real API key
   - Run the script again to update the MCP settings file

2. **Supabase MCP Server**:
   - Investigate the correct configuration format for the Supabase MCP server
   - Update the `fix-supabase-server.js` script with the correct configuration
   - Run the script again to update the MCP settings file

3. **Git MCP Server**:
   - Investigate the correct request format for the Git MCP server
   - Update the `check-mcp-status.js` script to use the correct request format
   - Run the script again to check the status of the Git MCP server

## Conclusion

The fix scripts have successfully updated the MCP settings file, but further configuration is needed to fully fix all the MCP servers. The Weather server is the closest to being fully functional, only requiring a valid API key. The Supabase and Git servers require more investigation to determine the correct configuration format.
