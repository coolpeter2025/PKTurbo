# Supabase Keep-Alive Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Supabase keep-alive functionality to prevent your Supabase free project from being paused due to inactivity.

## Implementation Options

We've implemented two different GitHub Actions workflows for keeping your Supabase project active:

1. **Using Pre-built Action** (`.github/workflows/supabase-keep-alive.yml`)
   - Utilizes the `jps27cse/supabase-keep-alive` action
   - Simpler implementation with fewer dependencies
   - Relies on a third-party action

2. **Custom Implementation** (`.github/workflows/supabase-keep-alive-custom.yml`)
   - Direct implementation using Node.js and Supabase JS client
   - More control over the exact query and error handling
   - No dependencies on third-party actions

Both options query the `contact_submissions` table to keep your Supabase project active.

## Local Testing Results

We tested the Supabase keep-alive functionality locally using test scripts:

```
üîÑ Testing Supabase keep-alive functionality...
üîó Connecting to: https://stagfacvrlrtstshuwux.supabase.co
‚úÖ Connection successful!
üìä Found 8 total records in contact_submissions table
üü¢ Supabase keep-alive test completed successfully
üìù Sample record ID: 24466938-f3ad-4104-bba4-82c4b5216c97
```

The successful test confirms:
1. The Supabase credentials are working correctly
2. The `contact_submissions` table exists and can be queried
3. The keep-alive mechanism is functional

## GitHub Secrets Configuration

Your Supabase credentials have been added to the `supabase-github-secrets-setup.txt` file, which includes step-by-step instructions for adding them as GitHub repository secrets:

1. SUPABASE_URL: `https://stagfacvrlrtstshuwux.supabase.co`
2. SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: (service role key available in the text file)

## Workflow Schedule

The workflows are configured to run:
- Automatically every day at 9:00 AM UTC
- Manually via the GitHub Actions UI whenever needed

## Verification Strategy

To verify that the workflow is working as expected:

1. Push the changes to GitHub
2. Add the required secrets to your GitHub repository
3. Manually trigger the workflow from the Actions tab
4. Check the workflow logs for successful execution
5. Monitor your Supabase dashboard to confirm the project remains active

## Test Scripts

Two test scripts have been created for local verification:

1. **ES Modules version**: `test-supabase-keepalive.js`
2. **CommonJS version**: `test-supabase-keepalive-commonjs.js`

Both scripts connect to your Supabase project and query the `contact_submissions` table, simulating what the GitHub Action will do.

## Maintenance Considerations

- The workflow will continue to run indefinitely as scheduled
- If you change your Supabase credentials, remember to update the GitHub secrets
- You can modify the schedule by changing the cron expression in the workflow files
